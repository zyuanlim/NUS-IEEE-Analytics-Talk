# NUS- IEEE Young Professionals Singapore - Data Analytics and Machine Learning Talk

This repository contains the codes and slides for my talk in NUS on 16th October, where I talked about various ways to dissect/interpret black box machine learning models. The *PeekingIntoTheBlackBox* (jupyter) notebook contains the main python codes for my demo. The slides (in html) are generated by a jupyter notebook *Reveal.js* slideshow extension and the pdf is generated from the html.

The *pdp_wine.R* is a R script where I generated the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) using the *pdp* R library.

Feel free to raise an issue if you encounter any difficulty in reproducing the results or have any questions in general. Thanks.
